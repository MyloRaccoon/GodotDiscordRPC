# Godot Discord RPC
To show every one what your are doing on the Godot Engine editor.
## Installation
I don't plan on releasing it for now but you still can get the code and connect it to your own discord application. You just need to put the client id in a .env file with some other configuration then execute the main.py file then your good.
